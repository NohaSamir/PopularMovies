API Hints

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to [create one](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup) in order to request an API Key. 
   
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

After generate your API key put it inside string.xml file 
<string name="api_key" translatable="false">[YOUR_API_KEY]</string>
    
In order to request popular movies you will want to request data from the /movie/popular [documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover). An API Key is required.
Once you obtain your key, you append it to your HTTP request as a URL parameter like so:
http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
